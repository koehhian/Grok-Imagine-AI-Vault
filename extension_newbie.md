# 🧩 How to Install the Vault Helper Extension

If you've never installed a browser extension manually, follow these steps. It only takes a minute!

## 1. Prepare the Extension Folder
First, ensure you have downloaded the project (see the [Main Guide](README.md#getting-started)).
Find the folder named `grok-extension` in the project directory.

## 2. Load the Extension into your Browser

### For Chrome, Edge, or Brave Users
1. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`).
2. **Crucial:** Turn on **"Developer mode"** (usually a toggle in the top right corner).
3. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
4. Select the `grok-extension` folder from the project you just downloaded.
5. **Success!** You should now see the "Vault 助手" icon in your toolbar.

### For Firefox Users
1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on..."**.
3. Navigate to the `grok-extension` folder and select any file inside (like `manifest.json`).
4. **Note:** Firefox temporary extensions are removed when you restart the browser. To keep it permanently, you would need to sign it via Mozilla (advanced).

## 3. Using the Extension
